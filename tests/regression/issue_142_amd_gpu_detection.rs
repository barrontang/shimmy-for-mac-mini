/// Regression test for Issue #142: AMD GPU not detected on Windows (Vulkan/OpenCL)
///
/// GitHub: https://github.com/Michael-A-Kuykendall/shimmy/issues/142
///
/// **v1.x Bug**: AMD GPU correctly detected by clinfo but all layers assigned to CPU instead of GPU
/// **v1.x Root Cause**: GPU backend environment variables not set before llama.cpp initialization
///
/// **v2.0 Resolution**: llama.cpp and GGML_* environment variables are fully removed.
/// GPU detection is now handled by wgpu, which enumerates adapters through the system
/// Vulkan/DX12/Metal driver stack — no environment variable injection required.
/// AMD GPUs on Windows are detected via Vulkan automatically when drivers are present.
