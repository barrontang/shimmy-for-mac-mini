# Changelog

All notable changes to Shimmy will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.2.1] - 2026-06-30

### Fixed
- **CI regression test cleanup** — Removed stale llama-era, MLX, and release-gate tests (17+ files, ~4500 lines). All CI test targets updated to use `--features airframe,huggingface` defaults.
- **Workflow consolidation** — Deleted 3 dead workflows (release-dry-run, test-release-binaries, version-validation). Release.yml rewritten from 373 to 66 lines as a clean matrix build.
- **Quality gate fixes** — Binary size test now uses debug+strip instead of slow release build. Variable expansion bug in quality gate fixed. MLX test no longer asserts x86_64-apple-darwin platform.

### Changed
- Airframe dependency updated to 0.2.8.

---

## [2.2.0] - 2026-06-09

### Fixed
- **Multi-architecture model loading** — Qwen3, Qwen2, Gemma-2, Phi-3 family models now
  load correctly via airframe 0.2.2. Previously these architectures silently failed due
  to a hardcoded Llama key prefix in the GGUF metadata parser.
- **Qwen3 tied embeddings** — Qwen3 models that share output.weight with token_embd.weight
  now load and run correctly.
- **Context cap safety** — Large-context models (Qwen2-7B n_ctx=32768) no longer cause
  memory exhaustion on CPU oracle generation paths.

### Changed
- Airframe dependency updated to 0.2.2.
- Shimmy version bumped to 2.2.0.

---

## [2.1.0] - 2026-06-02

### Added
- **TurboShimmy INT4 KV cache** — per-head-vector INT4 compression for KV buffers,
  cutting KV VRAM usage ~7× with no measured retrieval loss. Enable via
  `SHIMMY_KV_QUANT=int4`. See airframe 0.2.0 release notes.

### Fixed
- **wgpu 27 staging-buffer panic on GTX 1050 Ti and similar older GPUs** (issue #205,
  reported by @Kuntey). Upgraded to airframe 0.2.1, which fixes `max_buffer_size`
  being incorrectly capped to `max_storage_buffer_binding_size`. On some older GPU/driver
  stacks these limits differ, causing a deferred validation error that wgpu 27 surfaced as
  a cryptic "Staging Buffer is invalid" panic. A pre-flight size guard now returns a clear
  error message if the model exceeds the GPU's binding limit.
- Removed spurious `WARNING: Missing Norm Tensor post_attention_norm/post_ffw_norm` log
  spam for Llama, Mistral, Phi and Qwen models. These tensors are Gemma-only.

### Changed
- Airframe dependency updated to 0.2.1.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-05-26

### 🚀 **v2.0 PUBLIC RELEASE** — Airframe GPU Engine

This release replaces the llama.cpp inference backend with **Airframe**, a pure-Rust WGSL GPU inference engine. Airframe runs the entire transformer pipeline on GPU using WebGPU compute shaders — no C++ dependencies, no build flags, no platform matrix headaches. This is a major architectural break from v1.x.

The llama.cpp code path is **historically parked**, not deleted. It remains accessible via `--legacy` flag or `SHIMMY_ENGINE_BACKEND=llama` if needed.

### What's New Since v1.9.0

**New Default Engine: Airframe**
- Pure Rust — no C++ toolchain required at runtime
- WGSL compute shaders compiled on first launch; no pre-compiled shader artifacts
- F32 precision throughout (output head dequantized Q6_K → F32 on load)
- YaRN RoPE scaling for extended context via `SHIMMY_MAX_CTX` env var
- Stateless per-request inference with full KV cache reset between requests
- Model spec auto-derived from GGUF metadata — works with any GGUF-format model

**API**
- Added `POST /v1/completions` text completion endpoint (OpenAI-compatible)
- `POST /v1/chat/completions` now accepts `frequency_penalty` and `presence_penalty` fields; values map to `repeat_penalty = 1.0 + max(freq, presence) * 0.5`
- Input validation: empty `messages` array returns 400; `max_tokens` of 0 or above 131072 returns 400

**Inference**
- Fixed stop token propagation: `<|eot_id|>` (Llama-3) and other model-specific stop tokens from chat templates now correctly terminate generation; previously they were silently dropped and the model would generate until `max_tokens`
- Chunked prefill: prompts now processed in 512-token chunks (was one giant dispatch) — extended context viable again

**Model Configuration**
- Set `SHIMMY_BASE_GGUF=/path/to/model.gguf` to configure the default model
- Pass `--model-path /path/to/model.gguf` to the `serve` command as an alternative
- No more hardcoded developer paths shipped in the binary

**Model Discovery**
- Added `~/.cache/lm-studio/models` to auto-discovery search paths (fixes #184)

**Template Routing Fixed**
- TinyLlama, Llama-1, and Llama-2 models now correctly use ChatML template
- Llama-3 template reserved for models explicitly named `llama-3` / `llama3`

**Distribution**
- `cargo install shimmy` now works — crates.io package uses huggingface engine variant
- GitHub Releases provide platform binaries with the full Airframe WebGPU engine

### ⚠️ Migration from v1.x

**SHIMMY_BASE_GGUF is now required.** The default model is no longer hardcoded. Set the env var or pass `--model-path`.

**llama.cpp is historically parked.** Everything you could do with TinyLlama via llama.cpp works identically through Airframe. Opt back with `--legacy` or `SHIMMY_ENGINE_BACKEND=llama` if needed.

See `docs/MIGRATION_v2.md` for full migration steps.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-01-09

### 🎉 **KITCHEN SINK ARCHITECTURE** - One Binary, All GPUs

- Implemented proper `#[cfg(feature = "...")]` guards for conditional compilation
- Enhanced code quality through comprehensive clippy lint resolution
- **Achievement**: Professional-grade warning-free compilation across all feature combinations

**MILITANT CI/CD QUALITY GATES**
- **11 QUALITY GATES PASSING**: PPT, Security, Code Quality, Test Suite, Coverage, Cross-Platform Builds
- Platform-specific validation (Windows MSVC, macOS Intel/ARM, Linux x86_64)
- DCO compliance enforcement for legal code provenance
- **Zero-tolerance policy**: Every quality gate must pass before release

**PLATFORM-SPECIFIC OPTIMIZATION**
```rust
// Revolutionary platform-aware test design
#[test]
fn test_mlx_functionality() {
    if !cfg!(target_os = "macos") {
        println!("ℹ️ Skipping MLX test on non-macOS platform");
        return;
    }
    // MLX-specific testing only on Apple platforms
}
```

### 🔬 **PPT SYSTEM SUCCESS STORY**

**ARCHITECTURAL BUG DETECTION**
The PPT invariant system proved its value by catching a **CRITICAL SEMANTIC VIOLATION**:
- **Issue**: GGUF models weren't consistently routed to Llama backend
- **Detection**: PPT contract `assert_backend_consistency()` failed during model loading
- **Impact**: Fixed silent data corruption where models could use wrong inference engines
- **Validation**: 306/306 tests now pass with PPT invariants enforcing architectural integrity

**Production Integration Highlights**
```rust
// PPT contracts now enforce critical invariants
ppt::contracts::assert_model_loaded(model_name, success);
ppt::contracts::assert_generation_valid(prompt, response);  
ppt::contracts::assert_backend_consistency(model_type, backend);
```

### 🛠️ **SYSTEMATIC TIMEOUT ELIMINATION**

**METHODICAL DEBUGGING APPROACH**
Following the directive: *"check every single one that went overtime, determine test by test what's wrong, fix each individually"*

**MLX Apple Silicon Guards**
- Added `cfg!(target_os = "macos")` guards to prevent compilation failures on Linux/Windows
- **Tests Fixed**: `test_mlx_binary_status_messages`, `test_gpu_info_with_mlx_compiled`, `test_full_apple_feature_build_and_run`
- **Result**: MLX tests execute only on compatible Apple Silicon hardware

**Build Optimization Strategy**
- **Before**: `cargo build --release` (10+ minutes, frequent timeouts)
- **After**: `cargo check` + `cargo build` debug (30-60 seconds, reliable)
- **Impact**: 90% reduction in CI execution time with maintained quality

**Cross-Platform Verification**
- **Packaging Tests**: Eliminated `--release` flags from validation checks
